  <h1>How to Play</h1>
  <br>
  <p>The following rules will be the necessary rule to have an enjoyable, fair, and fun game. <p>
  <br>
  
  <h3>Objective</h3>
  <p>The objective of this game is to become the wealthiest player in the game and the last person standing.<br>This may be achieved through the loss of other players, or through a game timer of 15 minutes that starts when the game begins. When this occurs, a player wins.<br>It should be noted that the game is intentionally rigged, as the objective of the house is to make sure that players lose money and understand the intent and purpose of the game.<p>
  <br>
  
  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p>This game aims to demonstrate to players how gambling is a societal issue and that it can affect anyone due to its nature of risk, chance, and prize.<p>
  <br>
  
  <h3>Game Equipment and Pieces</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Main circuit game board (going around in a circle) with different colored squares</li>
      <li>Opportunity cards</li>
      <li>Bishop-shaped game pieces in 6 different colors</li>
      <li>2 dice</li>
      <li>In-game physical currency</li>
    </ul>
  <br>
 
  <h3>Game Preparation</h3>
  <ol>
      <li>Place the board on a table or an appropriate area of play</li>
      <li>Place opportunity cards face-down in the designated area of the game board</li>
      <li>Deal $100 in the form of the following bills to each player:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>1 $50 bill</li>
        <li>1 $20 bill</li>
        <li>2 $10 bills</li>
        <li>2 $5 bills</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Each player must choose one certain-colored game piece and place each piece at the ‘Start’ position</li>
      <li>Before beginning the play, every player must roll the dice to determine the order in which they will play. If players tie, they must continue to play tiebreakers until the order is decided.</li>
    </ol>
  <br>
  
  <h3>'Start'</h3>
  <p>Players begin at the “start” space. Every time players move on or past the space, players must receive $10 from the treasury. If players receive the “Advance to Start” opportunity card, they must go around the board, land on the “Start” space, and receive $10.<p>
  <br>
  
  <h3>Movement</h3>
  <p>Players must roll the dice to move anywhere on the board. If they land on a betting square, they must fulfill the requirements of the betting square. If they land on an opportunity card square, they must pick up an opportunity card and follow the instructions.<p>
  <br>
  
  <h3>Betting</h3>
  <p>The game board has certain squares designated with specific colors. Each square has a different multiplier, color, and maximum investment value.
<br>
Each color represents a multiplier. This multiplier gives players higher or lower chances of gaining or losing money. The higher the multiplier, the higher the maximum investment value, although there is a lower chance of winning as players are putting more at risk (high risk/high reward). There is also the opposite situation for different colors. The maximum investment value is represented by different colored squares.
<br>
For each square, players must roll a certain value in order to benefit from the multiplier and gain money. If players fail to meet the required dice number, the value they bet is lost and must go to the treasury.
<br>
The chart below expresses the relationship between each color, dice roll chance, multiplier, and maximum investment value:
<p>
<br>
  <table id="row">
    <tr>
      <th>Color</th>
      <th>Dice Roll Chance</th>
      <th>Multipler</th>
      <th>Maximum Input</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Red</td>
      <td>Land on 6</td>
      <td>5x</td>
      <td>$100</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>Orange</td>
      <td>Land on 5 or 6</td>
      <td>3x</td>
      <td>$70</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>Yellow</td>
      <td>Land between 4-6</td>
      <td>2x</td>
      <td>$50</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>Green</td>
      <td>Land between 3-6</td>
      <td>1.75x</td>
      <td>$30</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
      <td>Blue</td>
      <td>Land between 2-6</td>
      <td>1.25x</td>
      <td>$20</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <br>
  <br>
  
  <h3>Opportunity Cards</h3>
  <p>When a player lands on one of these spaces, they must pick up the card at the top of the stack. It will be labeled on the cards if players must read the card aloud or not. If it is NOT labeled, then players must keep the card for the duration of the game, and it is up to their discretion when they wish to use it. If it IS labeled, then players must read the instructions on the card and use the card according to the instructions. These cards may be sold as assets at any point in the game according to the tier level:
<br>
Each card has a labeled tier (Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3). Tier 3 is the highest tier, essentially denoting that it is more powerful than the other two tiers. Tier 3 cards may NOT be auctioned. Good cards (colored in green) ONLY may be auctioned. When a card is auctioned, the tier must be announced. The card will be locked in, and bids will be placed thereafter. Players may auction cards at any point in time when it is their turn, OR when they become bankrupt.
<br>
The base price for Tier 1 cards is $10.
$5 of the proceeds go to the treasury.
<br>
The base price for Tier 2 cards is $50.
$10 of the proceeds go to the treasury.<p>
  <br>
  
  <h3>The Treasury</h3>
  <p>The treasury is the location in which all money is located. There are denominations of $5, $10, $20, $50, $100, and $500. There are limited numbers of each. At the start of the game, players must take $100 from the treasury. The treasury collects all money that is interplayed in the opportunity cards.<p>
  <br>
  
  <h3>Bankruptcy</h3>
  <p>Players become bankrupt when they pick up a bankruptcy card, can no longer bet on squares with money, or they owe more than they can spend. When players become bankrupt, they have the following options.
  <br>
    <br>
 You may:
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li>(Only if you are indebted to another player) Give all money you have to the player. If you also have an opportunity card, look at the following</li>
      <li>
Auction cards that you are in possession of</li>
      <li>(If you have lost money through betting) Continue playing without betting until you have played two turns consecutively. After this, you must gamble, and if two turns are exceeded without betting you are eliminated. During your two turns, you have the opportunity to:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Pass go and collect some cash</li>
        <li>Land on opportunity cards and action them off immediately if they are an ADVANTAGE card</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
<p>
  <br>
  
  <h3>Miscellaneous Rules</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Players must gamble at least once every two runs</li>
    <ul>
      <li>A run is a turn, so players must bet after two turns</li>
     </ul>
  <li>Players must bet BEFORE the chance dice are rolled</li>
  <li>There is no treasurer in the game. It is the responsibility of every player to ensure that the money that is transacted from and out of the treasury is done with the utmost fairness for everyone taking a part in the game</li>
  </ul>
